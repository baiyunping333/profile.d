h1. My Bash Profile

This is the bash profile I use across all my macs and some of my servers. Its pretty general and can be used on almost any machine. This is all really heavily influenced by "Mat Schaffer":https://github.com/matschaffer/profile and the mess of peeps that have forked and contributed to his profile. My needs started getting too far from what he was doing so I pulled over a bunch of stuff and made it more my own.

h2. Some Stuff You Should Know

* Things that are specific to individual flavors are separated into flavor specific directories. (e.g. Linux, Darwin).
* Some assumptions are made about where applications are installed. You may need to change those parts for yourself. I've made notes in the "Other Jawns Installed":#other-jawns-installed section of this page.
